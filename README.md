# Read and prepare the circle points data
 Geom.csv -> contains 22 circle sample and each 
circle sample contains 61 points (x,y coordinates)
 Circles with different radius but all are centered 
around origin.
 Split the circle samples into training data (17 
samples) and testing data (5 samples)

# Building Autoencoders in Keras for 
reconstructing the circle points. 
 Start with a single fully-connected neural layer for 
the encoder and also for the decoder.
 Try different code sizes (60,30).
 Create a separate encoder model as well as the 
decoder model.
 Train the autoencoder to reconstruct the circle 
points using only the training data.

# Verifying Results of our Autoencoder (Repeat 
the below steps for different code sizes 
(60,30)).
 Encode the testing data using the encoder model.
 Given the generated codes -> use the decoder 
model to reconstruct the circle points.
 Visualize the reconstructed circle points against 
their original circle points using the Matplotlib.
 Set the axis range to the biggest circle across the data.
 plt.xlim(,) - plt.ylim(,)
